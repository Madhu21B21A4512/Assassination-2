Semantic queries on indexed objects allow the reuse of the 3D scenes.

Introduction

Nowadays, the 3D is a highly expanding media. More particularly with the emergence of dedicated standards such as VRML and X3D, 3D animations are widely used on the Web. The continuous evolution of computing capabilities of desktop computers is also a factor that facilitates the large deployment of 3D information contents. At the same time the demand in term of 3D information is becoming more and more sustained in various domains such as spatial planning, risks management, telecommunications, transports, defense, and tourism. 3D information should represent a real world scene as accurately as possible and should exhibit properties (like, topological relations) to allow complex spatial analysis [1].

The construction of a 3D scene is a complex and time consuming task. Thus, being able to reuse the 3D scenes is a very important issue for the multimedia...
Okay so series and dataframe are both objects of pandas.

Series is a one dimensional object that can any datatype , it can be int , float , string or anything. In simpler words series are somewhat like a list , but here you can define your index too . Instead of starting from 0 to len(n-1) , you can define your own index like a, b ,c which are similar to keys in dictionary.

Now DataFrame is a two dimensional object. It has columns and rows. Each column may have different types of values including list , tuples , dictionaries and even other dataframes too.

Introduction

As we know that, Data Science is the discipline of study which involves extracting insights from huge amounts of data by the use of various scientific methods, algorithms, and processes. To extract useful knowledge from data, Data Scientists need raw data. This Raw data is a collection of information from various outlines sources and an essential raw material of Data Scientists. It is additionally known as primary or source data. It consists of garbage, irregular and inconsistent values which lead to many difficulties. When using data, the insights and analysis extracted are only as good as the data we are using. Essentially, when garbage data is in, then garbage analysis comes out. Here Data cleaning comes into the picture, Data cleansing is an essential part of data science. Data cleaning is the process of removing incorrect, corrupted, garbage, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.When working with multiple data sources, there are many chances for data to be incorrect, duplicated, or mislabeled. If data is wrong, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. Data cleaning is the process of changing or eliminating garbage, incorrect, duplicate, corrupted, or incomplete data in a dataset. There’s no such absolute way to describe the precise steps in the data cleaning process because the processes may vary from dataset to dataset. Data cleansing, data cleansing, or data scrub is that the initiative among the general data preparation process. Data cleaning plays an important part in developing reliable answers and within the analytical process and is observed to be a basic feature of the info science basics. The motive of data cleaning services is to construct uniform and standardized data sets that enable data analytical tools and business intelligence easy access and perceive accurate data for each problem.

 

Why data cleaning is essential?

Data cleaning is the most important task that should be done as a data science professional. Having wrong or bad quality data can be detrimental to processes and analysis.

What is data cleaning?

When working with multiple data sources, there are many chances for data to be incorrect, duplicated, or mislabeled. If data is wrong, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. Data cleaning is the process of changing or eliminating garbage, incorrect, duplicate, corrupted, or incomplete data in a dataset.

Why data cleaning is essential?

Data cleaning is the most important task that should be done as a data science professional. Having wrong or bad quality data can be detrimental to processes and analysis. Having clean data will ultimately increase overall productivity and permit the very best quality information in your decision-making. Following are some reasons why data cleaning is essential:

Image source: by me

1. Error-Free Data: When multiple sources of data are combined there may be chances of so much error. Through Data Cleaning, errors can be removed from data. Having clean data which is free from wrong and garbage values can help in performing analysis faster as well as efficiently. By doing this task our considerable amount of time is saved. If we use data containing garbage values, the results won’t be accurate. When we don’t use accurate data, surely we will make mistakes. Monitoring errors and good reporting helps to find where errors are coming from, and also makes it easier to fix incorrect or corrupt data for future applications.

2. Data Quality: The quality of the data is the degree to which it follows the rules of particular requirements. For example, if we have imported phone numbers data of different customers, and in some places, we have added email addresses of customers in the data. But because our needs were straightforward for phone numbers, then the email addresses would be invalid data. Here some pieces of data follow a specific format. Some types of numbers have to be in a specific range. Some data cells might require a selected quite data like numeric, Boolean, etc. In every scenario, there are some mandatory constraints our data should follow. Certain conditions affect multiple fields of data in a particular form. Particular types of data have unique restrictions. If the data isn’t in the required format, it would always be invalid. Data cleaning will help us simplify this process and avoid useless data values.

3. Accurate and Efficient: Ensuring the data is close to the correct values. We know that most of the data in a dataset are valid, and we should focus on establishing its accuracy. Even if the data is authentic and correct, it doesn’t mean the data is accurate. Determining accuracy helps to figure out the data entered is accurate or not. For example, the address of a customer is stored in the specified format, maybe it doesn’t need to be in the right one. The email has an additional character or value that makes it incorrect or invalid. Another example is the phone number of a customer. This means that we have to rely on data sources, to cross-check the data to figure out if it’s accurate or not. Depending on the kind of data we are using, we might be able to find various resources that could help us in this regard for cleaning.

4. Complete Data: Completeness is the degree to which we should know all the required values. Completeness is a little more challenging to achieve than accuracy or quality. Because it’s nearly impossible to have all the info we need. Only known facts can be entered. We can try to complete data by redoing the data gathering activities like approaching the clients again, re-interviewing people, etc. For example, we might need to enter every customer’s contact information. But a number of them might not have email addresses. In this case, we have to leave those columns empty. If we have a system that requires us to fill all columns, we can try to enter missing or unknown there. But entering such values does not mean that the data is complete. It would be still being referred to as incomplete.

5. Maintains Data Consistency: To ensure the data is consistent within the same dataset or across multiple datasets, we can measure consistency by comparing two similar systems. We can also check the data values within the same dataset to see if they are consistent or not. Consistency can be relational. For example, a customer’s age might be 25, which is a valid value and also accurate, but it is also stated as a senior citizen in the same system. In such cases, we have to cross-check the data, similar to measuring accuracy, and see which value is true. Is the client a 25-year old? Or the client is a senior citizen? Only one of these values can be true. There are multiple ways to for your data consistent.

By checking in different systems.By checking the source.By checking the latest data.Data Cleaning Cycle

It is the method of analyzing, distinguishing, and correcting untidy, raw data. Data cleaning involves filling in missing values, distinguish and fix errors present in the dataset. Whereas the techniques used for data cleaning might vary in step with different types of datasets, the following are standard steps to map out data cleaning:
create n-dimensional dataframes. I've heard of a method for 3D dataframes using panels in pandas but, if possible, I would like to extend the dimensions past 3 dims by combining different datasets into a super dataframe

I tried this but I cannot figure out how to use these methods with my test dataset -> Constructing 3D Pandas DataFrame

Also, this did not help for my case -> Pandas Dataframe or Panel to 3d numpy array

I made a random test dataset with arbitrary axis data trying to mimic a real situation; there are 3 axis (i.e. patients, years, and samples). I tried adding a bunch of dataframes to a list and then making a dataframe with that but it didn't work :( I even tried a panel as in the 2nd link above but I couldn't get it to work either.

Does anybody know how to create a N-dimensional pandas dataframe w/ labels?

The first way I tried:

#Reproducibility np.random.seed(1618033) #Set 3 axis labels/dims axis_1 = np.arange(2000,2010) #Years axis_2 = np.arange(0,20) #Samples axis_3 = np.array(["patient_%d" % i for i in range(0,3)]) #Patients #Create random 3D array to simulate data from dims above A_3D = np.random.random((years.size, samples.size, len(patients))) #(10, 20, 3) #Create empty list to store 2D dataframes (axis_2=rows, axis_3=columns) along axis_1 list_of_dataframes=[] #Iterate through all of the year indices for i in range(axis_1.size): #Create dataframe of (samples, patients) DF_slice = pd.DataFrame(A_3D[i,:,:],index=axis_2,columns=axis_3) list_of_dataframes.append(DF_slice) # print(DF_slice) #preview of the 2D dataframes "slice" of the 3D array # patient_0 patient_1 patient_2 # 0 0.727753 0.154701 0.205916 # 1 0.796355 0.597207 0.897153 # 2 0.603955 0.469707 0.580368 # 3 0.365432 0.852758 0.293725 # 4 0.906906 0.355509 0.994513 # 5 0.576911 0.336848 0.265967 # ... # 19 0.583495 0.400417 0.020099 # DF_3D = pd.DataFrame(list_of_dataframes,index=axis_2, columns=axis_1) # Error # Shape of passed values is (1, 10), indices imply (10, 20) 

2nd way I tried:

DF = pd.DataFrame(axis_3,columns=axis_2) #Error: #Shape of passed values is (1, 3), indices imply (20, 3) # p={} # for i in axis_1: # p[i]=DF # panel= pd.Panel(p) 

I could do something like this I guess, but I really like pandas and would rather use one of their methods if one exists:

#Set data for query query_year = 2007 query_sample = 15 query_patient = "patient_1" #Index based on query A_3D[ (axis_1 == query_year).argmax(), (axis_2 == query_sample).argmax(), (axis_3 == query_patient).argmax() ] #0.1231212416981845 

It would be awesome to access the data in this way:

DF_3D[query_year][query_sample][query_patient] #Where DF_3D[query_year] would give a list of 2D arrays (row=sample, col=patient) # DF_3D[query_year][query_sample] would give a 1D vector/list of patient data for a particular year, of a particular sample. # and DF_3D[query_year][query_sample
Plotting

Pandas uses the plot() method to create diagrams.

We can use Pyplot, a submodule of the Matplotlib library to visualize the diagram on the screen.

Read more about Matplotlib in our Matplotlib Tutorial.

Example

Import pyplot from Matplotlib and visualize our DataFrame:

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.plot()

plt.show(
Scatter Plot

Specify that you want a scatter plot with the kind argument:

kind = 'scatter'

A scatter plot needs an x- and a y-axis.

In the example below we will use "Duration" for the x-axis and "Calories" for the y-axis.

Include the x and y arguments like this:

x = 'Duration', y = 'Calories'
